Thus, they are present during the acolytes' first lessons, during the Ceremony of Measuring, during the initiates' intense training, and at each of the trials that are part of an initiate's journey.",

"Bards of the College of Satire are called jesters. They use lowbrow stories, daring acrobatics, and cutting jokes to entertain audiences, ranging from the crowds in a rundown dockside pub to the nobles of a king's royal court. Where other bards seek forgotten lore or tales of epic bravery, jesters ferret out embarrassing and hilarious stories of all kinds. Whether telling the ribald tale of a brawny stable hand's affair with an aged duchess or a mocking satire of a paladin of Helm's cloying innocence, a jester never lets taste, social decorum, or shame get in the way of a good laugh.",
"While jesters are masters of puns, jokes, and verbal barbs, they are much more than just comic relief. They are expected to mock and provoke, taking advantage of how even the most powerful folk are expected by tradition to endure a jester's barbs with good humor. This expectation allows a jester to serve as a critic or a voice of reason when others are too intimidated to speak the truth.",
"For the duchess with a taste for strapping young laborers, such tales might serve to warn the targets of her affections and force her to change her ways for lack of willing partners. Striking back at the jester only ruins her already damaged reputation, and might provide the best evidence that the jester's satires have hit their mark. But if she is kind and generous to her conquests, the jokes and stories cast her as a kind of folk hero, while drawing even more potential partners to her.",
"Jesters are loyal to only one cause: the pursuit and propagation of the truth. They use their comedy and innocuous appearance to break down social barriers and expose corruption, incompetence, and stupidity among the rich and powerful. Whether revealing a con artist's treachery or exposing a baron's plans for war as driven by greed and bloodlust, a jester serves as the conscience of a realm.",
"Jesters adventure to safeguard the common folk and to undermine the plans of the rich, powerful, and arrogant. Their magic bolsters allies' spirits while casting doubt into foes' minds. Among bards, jesters are unmatched acrobats, and their ability to tumble, dodge, leap, and climb makes them slippery opponents in battle.",

"An Arcane Archer studies a unique elven method of archery that weaves magic into attacks to produce supernatural effects. Arcane Archers are some of the most elite warriors among the elves. They stand watch over the fringes of elven domains, keeping a keen eye out for trespassers and using magic-infused arrows to defeat monsters and invaders before they can reach elven settlements. Over the centuries, the methods of these elf archers have been learned by members of other races who can also balance arcane aptitude with archery.",

"The definitive treatise on all that is good in the multiverse, the fabled Book of Exalted Deeds figures prominently in many religions. Rather than being a scripture devoted to a particular faith, the book's various authors filled the pages with their own vision of true virtue, providing guidance for defeating evil.",
"The Book of Exalted Deeds rarely lingers in one place. As soon as the book is read, it vanishes to some other corner of the multiverse where its moral guidance can bring light to a darkened world. Although attempts have been made to copy the work, efforts to do so fail to capture its magical nature or translate the benefits it offers to those pure of heart and firm of purpose.",
"A heavy clasp, wrought to look like angel wings, keeps the book's contents secure. Only a creature of good alignment that is attuned to the book can release the clasp that holds it shut. Once the book is opened, the attuned creature must spend 80 hours reading and studying the book to digest its contents and gain its benefits. Other creatures that peruse the book's open pages can read the text but glean no deeper meaning and reap no benefits. An evil creature that tries to read from the book takes 24d6 radiant damage. This damage ignores resistance and immunity, and can't be reduced or avoided by any means. A creature reduced to 0 hit points by this damage disappears in a blinding flash and is destroyed, leaving its possessions behind.",
"Benefits granted by the Book of Exalted Deeds last only as long as you strive to do good. If you fail to perform at least one act of kindness or generosity within the span of 10 days, or if you willingly perform an evil act, you lose all the benefits granted by the book.",

You can dismiss or manifest the halo as a bonus action. While present, the halo gives you advantage on Charisma Persuasion checks made to interact with good creatures and Charisma (Intimidation) checks made to interact with evil creatures. In addition, fiends and undead within the halo's bright light make attack rolls against you with disadvantage.",
"Destroying the Book. It is rumored that the Book of Exalted Deeds can't be destroyed as long as good exists in the multiverse. However, drowning the book in the River Styx removes all writing and imagery from its pages and renders the book powerless for 1d100 years."

The Draakhorn is a signaling device, and it is so large that it requires two Medium creatures (or one Large or larger) to hold it while a third creature sounds it, making the earth resonate to its call. The horn has been blasted with fire into a dark ebony hue and is wrapped in bands of bronze with draconic runes that glow with purple eldritch fire.",

A failure indicates the character can advance no farther toward the entry.",

Success indicates the deafness ends 2 minutes after the Draakhorn ceases to sound. Failure indicates the character remains deafened for 1 hour after the Draakhorn ceases to sound.",

On a failed save, the creature takes 27 (6d8) thunder damage and is knocked prone. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage and isn't knocked prone."

The gold piece is the standard unit of measure for wealth, even if the coin itself is not commonly used. When merchants discuss deals that involve goods or services worth hundreds or thousands of gold pieces, the transactions don't usually involve the exchange of individual coins. Rather, the gold piece is a standard measure of value, and the actual exchange is in gold bars, letters of credit, or valuable goods.",
"One gold piece is worth ten silver pieces, the most prevalent coin among commoners. A silver piece buys a laborer's work for a day, a flask of lamp oil, or a night's rest in a poor inn.",
"One silver piece is worth ten copper pieces, which are common among laborers and beggars. A single copper piece buys a candle, a torch, or a piece of chalk.",
"In addition, unusual coins made of other precious metals sometimes appear in treasure hoards. The electrum piece (ep) and the platinum piece (pp) originate from fallen empires and lost kingdoms, and they sometimes arouse suspicion and skepticism when used in transactions. An electrum piece is worth five silver pieces, and a platinum piece is worth ten gold pieces.",

On a success, the creature ceases to be affected by the barrier."

Orcus|OotA} allows the wand to slip from his grasp from time to time. When it does, it magically appears wherever its master senses an opportunity to achieve some fell goal.",
"Made from bones as hard as iron, the wand is topped with a magically enlarged skull that once belonged to a human hero slain by  Orcus|OotA}. The wand can magically change in size to better conform to the grip of its user. Plants wither, drinks spoil, flesh rots, and vermin thrive in the wand's presence.",
"Any creature besides  Orcus|OotA} that tries to attune to the wand must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, the creature takes 10d6 necrotic damage. On a failed save, the creature dies and rises as a  zombie.",

Once you use this property of the wand, you can't use it again until the next dawn.",

In order to further its master's goals, the wand feigns devotion to its current user and makes grandiose promises that it has no intention of fulfilling, such as vowing to help its user overthrow  Orcus|OotA}.",
"Destroying the Wand. Destroying the Wand of Orcus requires that it be taken to the Positive Energy Plane by the ancient hero whose skull surmounts it. For this to happen, the long-lost hero must first be restored to life — no easy task, given the fact that  Orcus|OotA} has imprisoned the hero's soul and keeps it hidden and well guarded.",
"Bathing the wand in positive energy causes it to crack and explode, but unless the above conditions are met, the wand instantly reforms on  Orcus|OotA|Orcus's} layer of the Abyss."

Centuries ago, a dwarf named Ctenmiir wielded it valiantly for a time. But Ctenmiir was turned into a  vampire. His will was strong enough that he bent Whelm to his evil purposes, even killing members of his own clan."

"Built by dwarven gods and entrusted to the rulers of Shanatar, an ancient dwarven empire. The Wyrmskull Throne was a symbol of dwarven power and pride for ages untold. The throne hovers a foot off the ground and is a massive thing made of polished obsidian with oversized feet—the impaled skulls of four ancient blue dragons. Runes glisten in the carved obsidian winking to life with blue energy when the throne's powers are activated.",
"After the fall of Shanatar, the Wyrmskull Throne fell into the clutches of less honorable creatures. A band of adventurers wrested the throne from the aquatic elf tyrant Gantar Kraok and sold it to the  storm giant Neri for a considerable fortune. Neri had the throne magically enlarged and gave it to her husband, King Hekaton, as a gift, along with one of the Ruling Scepters of Shanatar, which she had found in a wreck at the bottom of the Trackless Sea. Only a creature attuned to a Ruling Scepter and in possession of it can harness the powers of the Wyrmskull Throne, which has become the centerpiece of King Ilekaton's throne room in the undersea citadel of Maelstrom. Fear of the throne's power has helped prevent evil giants from challenging or threatening Hekaton's leadership.",
"Any creature not attuned to a Ruling Scepter who sits on the throne is paralyzed and encased in a magical force field. While encased, the creature can't be touched or moved from the throne. Touching a Ruling Scepter to the force field dispels the field, though the creature remains paralyzed until it is separated from the throne.",
"Any creature seated on the throne can hear faint Whispers in Draconic- the whisperings of four blue dragons whose skulls adorn the throne. Although powerless, these spirits try to influence the decisions of the throne's master",
"Properties of the Throne. The throne has 9 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dawn. A creature that sits on the throne while attuned to a Ruling Sceptor in its possession can harness the throne's properties, which are as follows:",
"The throne gains a flying speed of 30 feet and can hover and flies where the creature wills. This property doesn't expend any charges.",
"Both the throne and the creature sitting on it can move through earth and stone without disturbing the material they move through. This property doesn't expend any charges.",
"As an action, the creature can expend 1 charge to cast  lightning bolt (spell save DC 19) from the throne. The spell is cast as though using a 9th-level spell slot and deals 49 (14d6) lightning damage. The bolt discharges from the mouth of one of the throne's blue dragon skulls.",
"As an action, the creature can expend 2 charges to cast the  globe of invulnerability spell from the throne. The globe encloses both the creature and the throne.",
"As an action, the creature can expend 3 charges to create a spectral image of an  ancient blue dragon that surrounds both it and the throne. The spectral dragon lasts for 1 minute. At the end of each of the creature's turns, the spectral dragon makes one bite attack and two claw attacks against targets of the creature's choice. These attacks have the same attack bonus, reach, and damage as an  ancient blue dragon|mm|ancient blue dragon's} bite and claw attacks.",
"Destroying the Throne. The Wyrmskull Throne can be destroyed by breaking at least five Ruling Scepters of Shanatar simultaneously on it. This fact has never been recorded or sung of among the dwarves or any bards or storytellers, and it can't be discovered with an ability check. Characters who want to destroy the throne must go on a quest to learn the method for doing so. The throne's destruction triggers an explosion, as shards of obsidian fly out in all directions. Each creature and object within a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on the throne must succeed on a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw, taking 70 (20d6) slashing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one."

The ice creature must be modeled after a beast with a challenge rating of 2 or less. The ice creature has the same statistics as the beast it models, with the following changes: the creature is a construct with vulnerability to fire damage, immunity to cold and poison damage, and immunity to the following conditions: charmed, exhaustion, frightened, paralyzed, petrified, and poisoned. The ice creature obeys only its creator's commands. The ice object or creature appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of you. It melts into a pool of normal water after 24 hours or when it drops to 0 hit points. In extreme heat, it loses 5 (1d10) hit points per minute as it melts.

 "Magic Item History": [
   "The item was made about 90 years ago. Forged by dwarves, the maker’s name is a mystery. Dwarves tell the story of it slaying a great wyrm. It was thought destroyed by the Order of Righteous Atonement in the City-State of Helios. Bards think its maker was a dragon in disguise.",
   "The item was created over 800 years ago. There does not seem to be any exotic material used in its creation. The item was forged by humans far to the east. Wise men say it took part in the slaying of a mighty lich. Lore links it with the wizard Kennul the Great, and sages say it is sought by the White Walkers Cult.",
   "The item was forged nearly 850 years ago. There are slight traces of mithral in its manufacture.",
   "The item was forged by goblinoids near the town of Ballinstock. Legends have forgotten the blade, thinking it a mere toy of goblins. Lore links it to a druid named Wortimel. Who have even said it was forged under a full moon.",
   "The item is probably over 400 years old. It was forged by the dwarven soulsmith Oribindu, near Old Kranalar. Eastern monks say it was used to banish a great lizard king or serpentine warlord. Whatever other secrets the item holds are lost.",
   "The item is not old; estimated construction took place about 115 years ago. There does not seem to be any exotic material used in its manufacture. The item was forged by dwarves far to the southeast. Those dwarves say it took part in the downfall of a great vampire cult. It was last owned by the ambassador Gelda, the Binder of Truth.",
   "The item’s age is difficult to pinpoint. The item was forged by an unknown human hand, far to the west. The elf lord Rinlenial used the weapon during his crusade in the Forest of Woe. It was thought to have been destroyed by a monk, but rumors persist that it is buried in a tomb. It is still mentioned in song and story nationwide.",
   "The item’s age is hard to ascertain. Dwarves forged the item, possibly near Cryn Durnel. Some say its maker was a genius. A druid named Futhasol was last known to possess it, although it is unknown if he destroyed it or not.",
   "The item is over 1,000 years old and there are traces of gemstones in its creation. The item was forged by orcs, possibly near Grymfog Hill. Orcs claim is was made to destroy dragons. Selayth, a sage, knows its true power.",
   "The item’s age seems impossible to divine, but it bears the signature of Alna Syllen, an elven smith near Erinwell. Elves say a human ranger, Belor, stole the item before it was lost to time.",
   "The item is just over 400 years old. Sages record that a god’s blood and claws were used in its creation, so that it might later be used to destroy a mighty demon. It is now sought by a holy order of nomads.",
   "The item’s age is hard to discern. There are slight traces of aberration essence in its manufacture. Dwarves forged the item near Kryn Karran. The creator etched “Falonak” in runes on the hilt, but songs say the maker was mad.",
   "The item’s age is hard to discern without advanced study, but there are no traces of special material used in its making. The item was forged by celestials, but exactly where is unknown. Tales say it took part in the legendary campaigns of the ghaele. Sages link it to the god of knowledge. What secrets this item holds are unknown.",
   "The item’s age is about 500 years old, when it was forged by dwarves, possibly near Anar Bhor.  Gilkascral, the dwarven smith, crafted it. Poets say it was used to kill the hero Protus Nodor, who is remembered in songs. Lore links it with a rogue named Rosha the Red. Nothing else is known about the item.",
   "The item could have been forged over 600 years ago. There might even be traces of a meteorite in it. Humans forged the item — the exact maker’s name is lost to time — near Kragenmoor. Monks claim it took over a hundred men to craft it. History links it to Lyrvan the Commanding and his victories over the gnoll lord of Ulyag.",
   "The item is over 400 years with traces of obsidian in its manufacture. The item’s crafter is unknown, but elves say it was used to banish a devil and that the fey aided in its creation. Lore is slim at best, and attempts to find a last owner have been futile due to time and a lack of credible stories.",
   "The item is over 700 years old. The item’s manufacture is simple and almost elementary, which comes as no surprise, since it was forged by ogres, Chajkl to be exact, near the Forest of Athmore. Historians claim it was used to defeat a great lizardfolk cult which followed the black wyrm Dunig’graz (which few believe), while bardic lore links it with a hermetic cleric named Olafsool.",
   "The item is less than 150 years old, with slight traces of infernal essence. Humans forged the item near Kalastan but the creator’s name has been forgotten. Whispers tell of a demon stripping the man’s name from history. History tells of three kings dying from its power. Yet there are those who still seek it.",
   "The item’s age is impossible to ascertain. Since no exotic materials were used in its creation, it’s hard to tell where it even came from. Rumors persist of a dragon forging it, but no proof has ever existed. Tales range from evil men destroying cities with it to idealistic wizards rebuilding entire nations. It is though the weapon came from nothing.",
   "The item’s age is difficult to pinpoint, and with traces of dragon essence in its manufacture, it is impossible to scry. The item was forged by a now-extinct family of elves near Ardin-Narr. The rise of the villainous Herise the Torturer is associated with the item, but bardic lore links it with Cathlin the Wrecker. Lastly, legends claim the creator was no elf at all, but a dragon in disguise.",
   "The item was created perhaps 500 years ago. There are traces of giant blood in its creation. Since it was forged by the dark elves of Athvar Fen, it is quite possible that demon eggs were used. There are no markings denoting the creator, however. Determining the true source of its power is difficult. Dwarves say it took part in the death of a powerful ice elf queen, which many suspect is simply myth and conjecture. Lore links it to a monk named Orlan. Sages claim that a true ice elven champion will rise, chosen by the god of battle and favored among her followers. She will take the item and become a new avatar. If such a thing were to happen, all elvenkind would fall."

If a structure drops to 0 hit points, it collapses and potentially damages nearby creatures. A creature within half the distance of a structure's height must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 5d6 bludgeoning damage, is knocked prone, and is buried in the rubble, requiring a DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check as an action to escape. The DM can adjust the DC higher or lower, depending on the nature of the rubble. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and doesn't fall prone or become buried."

The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be bound by the spell, if it succeeds, it is immune to this spell if you cast it again. While affected by this spell, the creature doesn't need to breathe, eat, or drink, and it doesn't age. Divination spells can't locate or perceive the target.",

"Burial: The target is entombed far beneath the earth in a sphere of magical force that is just large enough to contain the target. Nothing can pass through the sphere, nor can any creature teleport or use planar travel to get into or out of it.",
"The special component for this version of the spell is a small mithral orb.",
"Chaining: Heavy chains, firmly rooted in the ground, hold the target in place. The target is restrained until the spell ends, and it can't move or be moved by any means until then.",
"The special component for this version of the spell is a fine chain of precious metal.",
"Hedged Prison: The spell transports the target into a tiny demiplane that is warded against teleportation and planar travel. The demiplane can be a labyrinth, a cage, a tower, or any similar confined structure or area of your choice.",
"The special component for this version of the spell is a miniature representation of the prison made from jade.",
"Minimus Containment: The target shrinks to a height of 1 inch and is imprisoned inside a gemstone or similar object. Light can pass through the gemstone normally (allowing the target to see out and other creatures to see in), but nothing else can pass through, even by means of teleportation or planar travel. The gemstone can't be cut or broken while the spell remains in effect.",
"The special component for this version of the spell is a large, transparent gemstone, such as a corundum, diamond, or ruby.",
"Slumber: The target falls asleep and can't be awoken.",
"The special component for this version of the spell consists of rare soporific herbs.",
"Ending the Spell: During the casting of the spell, in any of its versions, you can specify a condition that will cause the spell to end and release the target. The condition can be as specific or as elaborate as you choose, but the DM must agree that the condition is reasonable and has a likelihood of coming to pass. The conditions can be based on a creature's name, identity, or deity but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities and not based on intangibles such as level, class, or hit points.",
"A dispel magic spell can end the spell only if it is cast as a 9th-level spell, targeting either the prison or the special component used to create it.",
"You can use a particular special component to create only one prison at a time. If you cast the spell again using the same component, the target of the first casting is immediately freed from its binding."

This spell might simply fail, the effect you desire might only be partly achieved, or you might suffer some unforeseen consequence as a result of how you worded the wish. For example, wishing that a villain were dead might propel you forward in time to a period when that villain is no longer alive, effectively removing you from the game. Similarly, wishing for a legendary magic item or artifact might instantly transport you to the presence of the item's current owner.",
